I am currently in my junior year of undergrad, graduating May of 2022. In addition to my computer\r\n                            science experience, I have had a significant amount of biomedical research experience as well, after \r\n                            interning at Harvard Medical School and publishing a first author research paper about the pancreatic protein\r\n                            CD39L3. \r\n                            <br/><br/>\r\n                            In terms of programming experience, my strongest language is Java with Python coming close in second. However,\r\n                            I have worked with several other programming languages/frameworks over the years, including C, JS, HTML, CSS, \r\n                            SML (academic functional programming language), Node.js, Golang, and React. I am very interested in new technologies,\r\n                            particularly machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I hope to do research in these fields during the\r\n                            upcoming semester. \r\n                            <br/><br/>\r\n                            Outside of professional/academic work, I have a strong interest in music; I have been playing piano since I was \r\n                            3 years old, and I've played violin for about 12 years. Currently, there are no recordings on my website, but I \r\n                            will likely upload some to the portfolio page.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n

We used Cordova and Node.js to build the app (in our presentation, we built it for android). We also used Google Maps API for location tracking, and we built a simple set of RESTful APIs to transfer location information.

I then measured the activity of these forms, included a model for the protein structure, and analyzed the potential impacts of these new glycoforms. This is a very watered down explanation of the proejct, but more information can found in my research paper, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal \\\"Purinergic Signaling\\\" and will be linked below. I also submitted this to the Regeneron Science Talent Search and was a National Semifinalist.\",\r\n        date: 201702\r\n      }]\r\n    var newArray = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\r\n    if(num == 0) {\r\n      this.setState({\r\n        elements: originalArray,\r\n        sortBy: 0,\r\n        sortingMethod: \"Recent\",\r\n        ascending: this.state.ascending\r\n      })\r\n    } else if(num == 1) {\r\n      newArray[0] = originalArray[2]\r\n      newArray[1] = originalArray[4]\r\n      newArray[2] = originalArray[3]\r\n      newArray[3] = originalArray[1]\r\n      newArray[4] = originalArray[0]\r\n      this.setState({\r\n        elements: newArray,\r\n        sortBy: 1,\r\n        sortingMethod: \"Name\",\r\n        ascending: this.state.ascending\r\n      })\r\n    } else {\r\n      newArray[0] = originalArray[0]\r\n      newArray[1] = originalArray[3]\r\n      newArray[2] = originalArray[4]\r\n      newArray[3] = originalArray[1]\r\n      newArray[4] = originalArray[2]\r\n      this.setState({\r\n        elements: newArray,\r\n        sortBy: 2,\r\n        sortingMethod: \"Type\",\r\n        ascending: this.state.ascending\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleSelection(index) {\r\n    this.setState({mode: false, selected: index})\r\n    console.log(\"hello\")\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleReturn() {\r\n    this.setState({mode: true})\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render () {\r\n      if (this.state.mode) {\r\n        return (\r\n          <div className='portfolio'>\r\n              {/* <h1 id='head-title'>Portfolio</h1> */}\r\n              <div className='sort-by'>\r\n                <h2 className='sort-title'>SORT BY</h2>\r\n                <div className=\"dropdown\">\r\n                    <button className=\"sort-btn dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\r\n                        {this.state.sortingMethod}\r\n                    </button>\r\n                    <div id=\"dropdown-stuff\" className=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\r\n                        <a className={this.state.sortBy == 0 ?
